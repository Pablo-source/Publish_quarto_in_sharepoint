## 1. Create new space in SharePoint

The first step is to create a new site in Sharepoint to host our Quarto reports. Later on we will use this site to collaborate with other team members.

Open SharePoint and navigate to the top left corner. Click on the Create site plus menu.

## 2. Creating a project and Quarto document

Proceed to create a new R project and a Quarto document, it will be saved as a .qmd file

![](Figures/01_R_project.png)

## 3. Create a new Quarto Reveal JS presentation

Using reveal js we will build and share and interactive presentation with navigation features to share with other team members.We start in RStudio creating a new Quarto presentation.

![](Figures/02_Create_quarto_revealjs_document.png)

This is the YAML section of the presentation with the different topics covered in the slides

![](Figures/03_Create_quarto_revealjs.png)


## 4. Populate your Quarto Reveal JS presentation

Write the content of your Quarto report. It is advised also to include an adhoc folder for Figures on the same project

![](Figures/04_populate_reveal_JS_presentation.png)

Define rendering properties of your Quarto in the top YAML section

We want to include author details and also system date. We use slide number to display page number of current slid and also use the logo parameter to include .png images from a images folder

![](Figures/05_yaml_reveal_JS_options.png)


## 4. Render your Quarto Reveal JS presentation

Once you have created your report, render it as you would normally do. You will obtain two files an '.html' and a '.qmd' file. And also the folder containing rendering outputs

Original QMD file and interactive HTML file

As this is Quarto presentation using reveal js, two files will be created, one for the standard markdown files and another for the Reveal js files

![](Figures/08_quarto_presentation_reveal_files.png)

## 5. Rename rendered .html file as .aspx

This first step of transforming the original .html file created by Quarto presentation into an interactive presentation involves changing the file extension. Right click on the .html file go to properties menu and on the General tab, change the .html file extension by .aspx 

You will see how the file change its icon after that

After we change it, its icon also changes 

![](Figures/10_change_html_to_reveal.png)

## 6. Drag this new .aspx onto your OneDrive ( OneDrive NHS England)

A message will display on the screen letting you know the "Publish_Quarto_in_sharepoint_test.aspx" file is being copied over NHS England One Drive

![](Figures/15_OneDrive_Open_myfiles.png)

From this new window you have just opened, you will have to find .aspx file called  "Publish_Quarto_in_sharepoint_test.aspx" you just created. 

## 9.  Open `My files` menu from the left

## 13. Final Step. Copy the entire Folder with the suffix `_files` created when rendering your quarto document into Quarto presentations  Documents folder.

In this particular example, as this is a reveal js presentation, is adviced to copy both the reveal and markdown rendered folders

From your project folder where you created and rendered your initial document, find the folder containing rendering files from the Quarto document. It has the same name as your original .qmd file with a "_files" preffix.
